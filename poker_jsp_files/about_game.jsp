                    <td><span class="tf">Texas hold 'em (also known as hold 'em or holdem) is a variation of the standard card game of poker. Texas hold 'em consists of two cards being dealt face down to each player and then five community cards being placed face-up by the dealer—a series of three ("the flop") then two additional single cards ("the turn" and "the river" or "fourth and fifth street" respectively), with players having the option to check, bet, raise or fold after each deal; i.e., betting may occur prior to the flop, "on the flop", "on the turn", and "on the river". Texas Hold 'em is the "H" game featured in H.O.R.S.E and in H.O.S.E.</span><br><br>

                    Rank of Hands in Texas Holdem:</span><br><br>
                        <span class="tf">In texas hold em poker, players compare five card hands against each other to determine who wins. A player with a flush has a better hand than a player with a straight, for example. The following list is from best to worst, so any hand on the list beats any hand below it and loses to any hand above it.<br><br><br>
                            1>.Royal Flush - An Ace-High straight of one suit.<br>
                            2>.Straight Flush - A straight of entirely one suit.<br>
                            3>.Four-of-a-Kind (Quads) - Four cards of the same rank.<br>
                            4>.Full House (Full Boat, Boat) - Three-of-a-kind and a pair.<br>
                            5>.Flush - Five cards of the same suit.<br>
                            6>.Straight (Run) - Five cards of sequential rank. Note that in holdem, Aces can be high or low.<br>
                            7>.Three-of-a-Kind (Trips, Set, Triplets) - Three cards of the same rank.<br>
                            8>.Two Pair - Two cards of the same rank and another two cards of the same rank.<br>
                            9>.One Pair - Two cards of the same rank.<br>
                            10>.High Card - When you don't have any of the above, your highest card determines your hand.</span>

                    <td><span class="tf">After inserting money (or a barcoded paper ticket with credit) into the machine, play begins by placing a bet of one or more credits and pressing the "deal" button. The player is then given cards and has the opportunity to discard one or more of them in exchange for new ones drawn from the same virtual deck. After the draw, the machine pays out if the hand or hands played match one of the winning combinations, which are posted in the pay table.

Pay tables allocate the payouts for hands and are based on how rare they are, the game variation, and the decision of the game operator. A typical pay table starts with a minimum hand of a pair of jacks, which pays even money.</span><br><br>
