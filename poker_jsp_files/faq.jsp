    <tr>
        <td><span class="sub_title">Ans.</span></td><td><span class="tf">It occasionally occurs that due to reasons beyond our players' control, they are unable to act on their poker hand in time. At PokerStars, a player in a ring (non-tournament) game is normally allotted 25 seconds to act on their hand if it is a fixed limit poker game, and 35 seconds in a pot limit or no limit poker game. A warning message is displayed in the chat box when there are 15 seconds left to act. If there was a disconnection and a player returned before the timeout, he or she receives at least 10 seconds to act.  Less time to act is allocated at tables designated as ‘fast.’

If a player fails to act within the allotted time while being connected, the hand is folded by the system.

Additional time to act may be allocated in some games, depending on the situation.  The amount of extra time may vary depending on the game, but the concept is the same throughout – when faced with a decision in a larger pot, more time is given to return due to a disconnection. </span></td>

Each player's chip count will be reset to the amount at the beginning of the hand.</span></td>

        <td><span class="sub_title">Ans.</span></td><td><span class="tf">The minimum buy-in our poker room for Fixed Limit tables is ten times the small bet (the bet on the first two betting rounds). For example, on a $10/$20 table, the minimum buy-in would be $100. 

For No Limit and Pot Limit poker games, PokerStars offers different buy-in amounts for different tables. Standard tables have a maximum buy-in of 100 big blinds and a minimum buy in of 20, 30, or 40 big blinds. Tables labelled ‘Short’ and ‘CAP’ allow buy-ins of between 20 and 50 big blinds. ‘Deep’ tables offer a buy-in range of 100-250 big blinds.</span></td>

        <td><span class="sub_title">Ans.</span></td><td><span class="tf">Yes. PokerStars is happy for friends, relatives, and acquaintances to play at the same table as each other. However, when you do so, you are expected to play just as competitively against your friend as you would against any other player, and you must not share any information about the cards that you hold with them or make any playing agreements in secret (doing so is collusion, which is strictly prohibited).

If you have an agreement to share a bankroll, stake, or split profits with your friend, then in the interest of game integrity you must not play at the same cash game table or in the same Sit & Go tournament.

Players who live in the same household, whatever their relationship, must not play at the same cash game table or in the same Sit & Go tournament. In some cases, this restriction will be imposed automatically by the game software.</span></td>

        <td><span class="sub_title">Ans.</span></td><td><span class="tf">Yes, you are welcome to play in multiple ring games and tournaments simultaneously. For some players, this is one of the greatest features of online poker. In the interest of fairness to all players, we ask that if you do play multiple tables, you act promptly when it is your turn in either poker game. PokerStars currently has a limit of 24 ring game tables at once, and you can also play an unlimited number of tournaments.</span></td>

This ‘rebuy’ feature is intended to replenish the stack of a player who has legitimately lost their entire stack while playing poker. The new 1,000 chips are for the use of that player only. Re-buys acquired for purposes other than this are subject to forfeiture. 

Note that you may only replenish your play money chips up to three times per hour. This rule is intended to encourage more ‘serious’ play. If you use up your three rebuys, you will have to wait for the next hour to get more chips.</span></td>

        <td><span class="sub_title">Ans.</span></td><td><span class="tf">The play money poker tables can be identified by the tables beginning with the word 'Fun'. For Hold'em and Omaha, all play money tables are under the 'Play Money' tab. For other games, they are located at the bottom of the tables list, below the real money games. If you do not see any play money tables listed, it's possible that you have blocked them from showing. To check this, simply click on 'Options' > 'Lobby Display Options' in your main client lobby, and ensure that the 'Show Play Money Tables' option is selected.</span></td>
